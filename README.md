LED Stick Lamp, RGB+CCT strip with Gledopto Zigbee Controller

### Materials

- [Gledopto RGB CCT Strip](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32990834544.html/ "Gledopto RGB CCT Strip") 
- [Gledopto RGB CCT Zigbee Controller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32858603964.html "Gledopto RGB CCT Zigbee Controller")
- [Aluminum Extrusion LED Profile](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000050935203.html "Aluminum Extrusion LED Profile")
- 24v 3a Power Supply
- 3D printed parts (base, shell, cap)

### Printing
- For the shell, rotate the model 150 degrees so the slanted face is against the buildplate. Use tree supports or equivalent to support the extrusion tabs. Use the largest brim you can, as this thing wants to peel off due to the orientation.
- The base and cap are straightforward prints.
- Use at least a 20% infill to give everything some weight. The base isn't super stable, so the more weight the better.
- Total print time is ~30hrs on an Ender 3 with a standard PLA profile at .2mm layer height.
